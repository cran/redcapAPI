Changes in Version 1.2 (2015-02-01)
  * Code has been rewritten to make use of the `roxygen2` documenation style.
  * The function 'allocationTable' is added.  This assists in producing
    allocation tables for the randomization module.
  * Offline versions for 'exportRecords' and 'allocationTable' are 
    included.  These produce output identical to the API calls, but 
    operate based on the csv's downloaded via the user interface.

Changes in Version 1.1 (2014-10-01)
  * redcapAPI now depends on R 3.0.0 or higher
  * A bug fix was added.  When specifying the 'fields' and 'forms' arguments 
    in 'exportRecords', only the variables in 'fields' were being converted
    to the appropriate data types.  This has been corrected.
  * redcapAPI requires Hmisc 3.14-6 or higher.  This is a consequence of 
    the following item.  Please update your Hmisc package.
  * The Hmisc package was moved from the Suggests field to the Imports 
    field.  This reflects the addition of some of the label functions in 
    Hmisc being explicitly exported, making them available to import.  

Changes in Version 1.0.1 (2014-10-20)
  * Bug fix: in `importRecords` meta data was not previously exported 
    when a project info object was not provided.  This is now corrected
  * Bug fix: in `exportRecords` and `exportReports`, the checkbox labels
    weren't being returned as factor levels when `checkboxLabels=TRUE`.
    The behavior is now consistent with expectations.
  * Bug fix: in `compareRedcapVersion`, a logical check was failing due 
    to an ommitted argument in `grepl`.  This has been corrected.
  * added function `apiCall`.  This wraps a call to `tryCatch`.  If a 
    Gnu/TLS recv error is returned, the encoding is changed from 'gzip' 
    to 'identity' to successfully retrieve the API response.
  * `tryCatch` calls are added to `redcapProjectInfo` to prevent fatal 
    errors when one of the API functions casts an error.  The output 
    is modified to indicate where the problem occurred.  This is most 
    likely to affect `exportUsers`. An unresolved issue behind this is 
    logged in the issues on Github.
