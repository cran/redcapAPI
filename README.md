redcapAPI
======

*NOTE*: Ownership transfer of this package to VUMC Biostatistics is complete.
Existing tickets in the older git repo will be transitioned over the next couple months.

The research community owes a big thanks to [Benjamin Nutter](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI)
for his years of service keeping this package current.

The package `redcapAPI` is an R interface to REDCap (http://www.project-redcap.org/), originally created by [Jeffrey Horner](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner).

Please read the documentation on your institutions REDCap installation.

Issues may be reported at [Issues](https://github.com/vubiostat/redcapAPI/issues)

This package was developed under REDCap Version 13.2.4. Institutions can be a little behind on updating REDCap and so some features of the API may not always work.

*Possible deprecation*. The redcapDbConnection methods are underdeveloped as I don't personally have access to the REDCap database (and so am unable to test features).  If you have that kind of access, feel free to develop the redcapDbConnection methods.
