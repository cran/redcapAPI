redcapAPI
======

The package `redcapAPI` is an R interface to REDCap (http://www.project-redcap.org/), and is an actively developed fork of [redcap](https://github.com/vubiostat/redcap), originally created by [Jeffrey Horner](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner).

Please read the documentation on your institutions REDCap installation.

This package was developed under REDCap Version 5.8.2.  My institution is usually a little behind on updating REDCap and so some features of the API may not always be available.

The redcapDbConnection methods are underdeveloped as I don't personally have access to the REDCap database (and so am unable to test features).  If you have that kind of access, feel free to develop the redcapDbConnection methods.
